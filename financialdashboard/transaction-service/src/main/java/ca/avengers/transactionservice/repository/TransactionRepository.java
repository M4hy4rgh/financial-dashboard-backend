 * This will be implemented in the future.

 * This interface is used to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the User entity.
 * It extends the JpaRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
 * JpaRepository provides methods for performing CRUD operations on the entity.
 * The User entity is the model class that represents the user data in the database.
 * The User entity is annotated with the @Entity annotation to indicate that it is a JPA entity.
 * The @Table annotation is used to specify the name of the table in the database where the user data is stored.
 * The TransactionRepository interface extends the JpaRepository interface and provides additional methods for querying the Transaction data.
